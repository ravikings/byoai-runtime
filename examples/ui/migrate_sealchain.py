"""One-shot migration of sealchain.json to v2 canonical seals.

Every entry's seal is recomputed as the recorder-canonical leaf hash
(0x00-prefix + RFC 8785 canonical JSON via byoai.recorder.canonical), so all
entries speak one scheme. The result is verified, then re-signed with the
device key. Run after upgrading live_shield.py.
