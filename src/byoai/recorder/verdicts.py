"""Verdict recording: what the gate decided, written down where it survives.

:mod:`byoai.recorder.mandate` decides and :mod:`byoai.recorder.governed_tool`
enforces, and until this module existed the decision reached the integrator's
process logs and stopped there. A control whose only trace is a log line is not
evidence, and the evidence is the product.

Three rules shape everything here.

**The local ledger is the authoritative record.** A verdict is appended to the
same hash-chained :class:`~byoai.recorder.ledger.Ledger` the recorder already
keeps, as an ordinary :data:`~byoai.recorder.schema.EventKind.MANDATE_VERDICT`
event. Whether Coriqo is reachable has nothing to do with whether a denial gets
written down; shipping is strictly downstream of the write. Recording a verdict
is never allowed to raise into the tool call — a ledger that cannot write loses
a row and logs loudly, it does not turn a governed tool into a failing one.

**Recording is not on the decide path.** :meth:`MandateGate.decide
<byoai.recorder.mandate.MandateGate.decide>` still reads memory and returns,
with no I/O of any kind. Everything in this module runs *after* the verdict
exists, from ``governed_tool``'s enforcement seam, so the property that makes
the gate safe to call from anywhere is untouched.

**All three verdicts are recorded, not just denials.** ``allowed`` is the
denominator. "This agent made 4,120 tool calls, 9 of them outside its mandate"
is a different and much more useful sentence than "9 denials happened", and
only the first one can be produced from a record that keeps allows too.

Repeats and halts are not N identical rows
------------------------------------------
The fact worth having is not *a tool was denied*. It is *the agent went back at
a control it had already been refused, four times, and then the run stopped*.
The denial latch already counts that; this module seals it. A first denial
records ``reason: out_of_scope``; the second attempt records
``reason: repeat_denied`` with ``attempts: 2``; the attempt that trips the
threshold records ``reason: run_halted`` with ``halted: true``. The reason code
carries the distinction on the wire, and the local ledger event carries the
count, the run, the principal and the halt flag alongside it.

The outbox
----------
Shipping reads from a small sqlite outbox rather than from the ledger. The
ledger's own sync watermark belongs to the entry-ingest path, which ships the
whole chain contiguously; verdict batches are a second, differently-shaped
delivery of the same facts (Coriqo seals one governance event per batch), and
giving them their own queue keeps one from stalling the other.

Rows are claimed under a ``batch_key`` that is written down *before* the request
goes out, so a resend after a crash, a timeout or a 409 carries the same key —
which is what makes retrying a write safe here. Nothing is marked shipped until
Coriqo has answered, so a shipping failure costs a duplicate delivery at worst,
never a lost verdict.

What this costs the call path
-----------------------------
The ledger append and the outbox insert happen inline, on the same thread as
the tool call, for every governed call including allows. That is a local sqlite
write on each side, which is cheap but not free, and inside an async tool it
happens on the event loop. Correctness is protected — a failed write cannot fail
a call — but latency is not: a locked or slow ledger file slows every governed
call. Moving the outbox write off-thread is the obvious next step and is not
attempted here.

Arguments are not recorded
--------------------------
``@governed_tool(capture_arguments=True)`` binds a call's arguments onto the
:class:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.ProposedAction`, and a governed tool's arguments
routinely hold account numbers and credentials. Nothing redacts them yet, so
this module records **how many** were captured and never a key or a value —
not in the local ledger, and certainly not on the wire.
