"""The `byoai-shield` command: starts Shield, or says how to install what it lacks.

Shield signs its record with `cryptography`, which a plain install of
byoai-runtime does not bring in. Importing `byoai.integrations.shield` without
it raises a normal ModuleNotFoundError (right for a library); this launcher is
the one place that turns it into an instruction instead of a traceback.
