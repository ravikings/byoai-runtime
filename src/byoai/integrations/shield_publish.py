"""Coriqo Shield → Coriqo: publish this Mac's signed seal, rarely and reliably.

What goes out is one small thing: the chain's current checkpoint (Merkle
root, entry count, Ed25519 signature by this Mac's key), wrapped in the shape
Coriqo's existing device checkpoint route already stores
(``POST /v1/checkpoints/batch``, the same route the agent recorder uses). No
messages, no rule matches, no ledger rows.

Design goals, in order:

* **No support after setup.** Setup is one enrolment token, pasted once.
  After that the Mac signs every request with its own key; there is no API
  key or password on disk to rotate or leak.
* **Cheap.** One small request every ``every_hours`` (6 by default), plus
  "Send now": the new seal if the chain grew, otherwise a heartbeat.
* **Alive, not just quiet.** With nothing new, Shield resends its last
  accepted seal byte for byte. Coriqo treats it as a duplicate (no new row, no
  second entry) but notes that the Mac was heard from, so an idle Mac is not
  mistaken for a dead one by Coriqo's quiet-device alert. The heartbeat
  interval is kept between 1 and 6 hours whatever ``every_hours`` says, to stay
  well inside Coriqo's quiet threshold (24 hours by default).
* **Never breaks capture.** Publishing runs on its own thread, catches
  everything, and never blocks, slows or stops checking.
* **Self-healing.** A failure backs off (1 min, doubling, capped at 6 h,
  honouring ``Retry-After``) and retries on its own. State is written
  atomically and survives restarts. Coriqo dedupes by checkpoint id, so a
  resend after a crash is harmless.
* **One human-actionable state.** If Coriqo refuses this Mac (401/403: the
  device was revoked or the tenant moved), the status says so and what to do.
  Everything else fixes itself. A 401 that names the clock is not a refusal:
  the Mac's date is wrong, the status says so, and sending resumes on its own
  once it is fixed.

Every request also carries, at the top level of the signed body, ``sent_at``
(when this request left, so Coriqo can refuse a replayed one) and ``shield``
(is Shield checking traffic right now, and if not, why). The checkpoint entry
inside stays byte for byte the same on a heartbeat. A new entry also names
``record_id`` (this Mac's local record; a new id means it was wiped) and
``prev_chain_hash`` (the chain hash of the last entry Coriqo accepted), so
Coriqo can tell a record that restarted or skipped from one that grew.
