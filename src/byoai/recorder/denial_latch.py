"""The denial latch: what happens the *second* time an agent tries a denied tool.

:mod:`byoai.recorder.mandate` decides one call at a time, which leaves a hole
worth naming plainly. A denial stops the call it was about and nothing else, so
a model that ignores the refusal can attempt the same out-of-mandate tool for
as long as the loop keeps turning, and the record shows a row of identical
single denials with nothing tying them together. The interesting fact — *this
agent went at a control it had already been refused, four times in ninety
seconds* — is exactly the fact that fell on the floor.

The latch keeps it. It is keyed on ``(run_id, tool)`` and does three things:

**Refuses repeats without re-evaluating.** A tool already denied for this run
denies again straight from the latch — no scope check, no snapshot read. Partly
because it is cheaper, mostly because it is more honest: the same tool against
the same snapshot cannot decide differently, so re-running the check would only
be theatre. The verdict handed back is the *original* one, re-labelled
:data:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.Reason.REPEAT_DENIED`, so whatever seals it later
sees the mandate version the refusal was actually made against.

**Counts.** :attr:`LatchedDenial.attempts` is the count including this attempt,
and it is on the verdict path rather than only in a log line so that the packet
that seals verdicts can seal the count with them.

**Halts.** At :data:`DEFAULT_HALT_THRESHOLD` attempts the run is over: every
subsequent call *for that run* — any tool, not just the denied one — raises
:class:`~byoai.errors.MandateRunHaltedError`. That is a subclass of
``MandateDeniedError``, so existing handlers keep stopping the call, and an
``isinstance`` check is what tells a supervising loop "this tool is refused, try
another" from "stop scheduling turns for this run".

What deliberately does **not** change is the sentence the model sees. It is the
same fixed :data:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.MODEL_MESSAGE` on the first denial,
the repeat and the halt. Escalating the detail as the agent tries harder would
hand it a hint sheet at precisely the moment it is probing the control.

Which run is this? Which agent?
-------------------------------
:class:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.ProposedAction` carries ``trajectory_id``, and
when it is set that is the run. Failing that, :func:`run_scope` binds one for a
block of calls. When neither is present the two obvious answers are both wrong:
one shared bucket lets unrelated agents in a process halt each other, and no
bucket at all switches the latch off for every integrator who has not threaded
trajectory ids through yet — which on day one is most of them, and the ones who
most need it.

So the fallback identity is the **gate**. One :class:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.MandateGate`
is built per agent per run in every wiring this package encourages, which makes
it the closest thing to a run identity available when nobody named one, and two
gate objects are definitionally two different mandates. The id is held in a
:class:`weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`, so a finished run's bucket goes away with
its gate rather than accumulating. The known imprecision runs the safe way: an
application that reuses one long-lived gate across several sequential runs
shares one bucket until it names them, which latches too eagerly rather than too
late.

Buckets also carry the **principal** — the agent id — alongside the run, because
a delegated sub-agent and its delegator share a run and do not share a scope. A
child's denial must not latch a tool the parent may legitimately still call. The
halt is the exception and is deliberately run-wide: once a run is over, which
agent asks next is beside the point.

Two limits, stated rather than hidden
-------------------------------------
Latch state is per-process and in memory. A run that spans two processes, or a
host that restarts mid-run, starts counting from zero. Persisting it is not
attempted here.

And a process that runs forever cannot remember every run it ever saw, so a
latch keeps at most :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_RUNS` runs and drops the oldest first.
The eviction order is insertion order, which is close enough to age for the
purpose: the runs at risk of being forgotten are the ones that stopped calling
tools a long time ago.
