"""External anchor receipt verification (spec section 6.2, level 4).

Level 4 is the last link in the seal model: a tenant epoch root (level 3,
see ``merkle.py``) gets submitted to something outside Coriqo's own control,
so a compromised Coriqo can't quietly rewrite history without also having to
forge an external timestamp. Two anchor types are supported, matching the
bundle sketch in ``internal_doc/recorder_contract_export_bundle.md``:

- ``rfc3161_tsa``: an RFC 3161 timestamp token from a Time Stamping
  Authority, verified via ``rfc3161ng`` against a TSA certificate supplied in
  the bundle. Only the message imprint and CMS signature are checked, and by
  default this module does NOT build a certificate chain to a trusted root
  (there is no root CA store anywhere in this codebase) — it only checks
  that each certificate in the supplied chain was directly issued by the
  next one, and reports whether the leaf cert is one that actually signed
  the token. "The chain is internally consistent" is not the same claim as
  "the TSA is trustworthy" — callers who need the latter must supply their
  own trusted roots via ``tsa_trusted_roots_pem`` (a list of PEM-encoded
  certificates), which makes ``verify_rfc3161_receipt`` additionally check
  that the supplied chain terminates at one of them. Even with
  ``tsa_trusted_roots_pem`` supplied, this module does not check the chain's
  ``pathLen``/``keyUsage`` constraints, nor the trusted root certificate's
  own validity period (see spec section 14). ``verify_bundle``'s
  ``require_pinned_anchors=True`` turns an RFC 3161 receipt whose chain was
  NOT checked against ``tsa_trusted_roots_pem`` into a finding instead of a
  note (same treatment as a Rekor receipt with no ``rekor_public_key_b64``,
  below) — a caller asking for pinned anchors is asking for every accepted
  anchor to actually be checked against a root or key it supplied, not just
  internally consistent.
- ``sigstore_rekor``: a Rekor transparency-log inclusion proof plus a signed
  entry timestamp (SET). Verifying the SET (and therefore that the receipt
  actually came from the log, not just that its Merkle path is internally
  consistent) requires the caller to supply the log's ``rekor_public_key_b64``
  — without it, `root_hash` and the audit path come entirely from the
  receipt itself, and any party can build a tree that "includes" the epoch
  root; the audit-path check alone proves nothing about a real log. The
  Merkle audit-path check implements RFC 6962
  section 2.1.1's ``PATH``/``MTH`` walk directly (not
  ``merkle.verify_inclusion``, which uses a different, simpler pairwise-node
  -promotion rule for odd leaf counts that is not guaranteed to produce the
  same audit paths Trillian/Rekor emit). It reuses ``merkle``'s domain-
  separated leaf/node hash primitives (``_leaf_hash``/``_node_hash``) so the
  two modules can never silently disagree on the RFC 6962 hash domain, even
  though the path-reconstruction algorithm around them differs. Despite the
  SET name (real Rekor signs its SET with ECDSA), this receipt's SET check
  verifies an Ed25519
  signature (``keys.DeviceKey.verify``, section 6.2's encoding) over this
  receipt's own canonicalized fields — it does NOT claim
  byte-for-byte compatibility with a live Rekor server's actual SET encoding,
  since this codebase never talks to a real Rekor instance. A real adapter
  translating live Rekor API responses into this receipt shape would need to
  confirm the exact signed-payload format against Rekor's own source.

Both verifiers are offline: no network access, caller supplies every key and
certificate needed.
