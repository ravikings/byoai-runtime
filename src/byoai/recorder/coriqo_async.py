"""Async, retrying client for Coriqo's agent API and its enforcement path.

:mod:`byoai.recorder.coriqo_agents` publishes finished runs from a script, so a
blocking ``httpx.Client`` that never retries is the right shape there: the
caller is already between turns, and a duplicate publish would corrupt the
record it exists to keep.

Mandate enforcement is a different shape. The runtime refreshes a cached policy
snapshot on a background interval while the agent is mid-turn, so a blocking
call there stalls the event loop for a whole round trip, and a single transient
blip would be read as "the policy could not be refreshed". This module is the
variant for that path:

* **async** — ``httpx.AsyncClient``, same construction options as the sync
  client (a caller-supplied client is never closed by :meth:`close`);
* **retrying, but only reads.** :class:`RetryPolicy` retries idempotent
  requests with exponential backoff and jitter, honours a server-sent
  ``Retry-After``, and leaves writes alone. A retried publish can duplicate a
  decision, and an accurate record is the whole product;
* **device-signed** where it has to be. Enforcement endpoints under
  ``/api/v1/agent-runtime/`` authenticate with the device key resolved by
  :mod:`byoai.recorder.identity`, never the static service-account key — the
  credential that fetches an agent's permitted scope must not be one the agent
  itself can use to widen that scope.

The error contract is the sync client's, unchanged: every failure is a
:class:`~byoai.recorder.coriqo_agents.CoriqoAgentsError` carrying
``status_code``/``detail``, with 423 raised as
:class:`~byoai.recorder.coriqo_agents.AgentSuspendedError`.

The signature format
--------------------
Coriqo verifies an Ed25519 signature over canonical JSON of::

    {"body_sha256": <hex sha256 of the exact request body bytes>,
     "method":      <uppercase HTTP method>,
     "path":        <path, plus "?"+query when a query string is present>,
     "public_key":  <the signer's own public key, lowercase hex>,
     "timestamp":   <the X-Coriqo-Timestamp value, verbatim>}

Everything that selects what a request does is covered, so a captured
signature cannot be replayed against a different method, path, query or body,
and the signer's own key sits inside the signed bytes so it cannot be replayed
under a different claimed identity. Coriqo accepts a timestamp up to 120s old
and 30s in the future, so every attempt — including a retry — is signed afresh
rather than resent with the timestamp of the attempt before it.

Note the encodings: the recorder's own wire format is base64
(``public_key_b64``, ``ed25519:<base64>`` signatures) and this API's headers
are hex. :func:`signing_payload` and :func:`device_headers` are the one place
that conversion happens.
