"""Wires the showcase's agents and runs into Coriqo.

All the reusable machinery lives in :mod:`byoai.recorder.coriqo_agents` —
credentials, the client, registration idempotency, reading sealed steps back
out of the ledger, publishing a session. What's left here is the part that is
genuinely specific to this demo: turning an ``AgentDef`` into an
:class:`AgentRegistration`, and deciding that a Coriqo failure must never take
down a run.

That second part is a policy choice, not a technical one. The core API raises
so a caller can decide; this app log-and-continues, because the ledger already
holds the authoritative record and a demo should keep working with Coriqo
switched off, mirroring how ``recorder/integration.py`` treats an unenrolled
device.
