"""The local mandate gate: does this agent's approved scope permit this tool?

Coriqo holds the approved mandate. This module enforces it *here*, inside the
agent's own process, from a cached snapshot refreshed on a background interval.

The one constraint everything else follows from: **the decide path performs no
network I/O.** Asking Coriqo synchronously before every tool call would make
the agent's availability a function of Coriqo's, and no regulated buyer ships
an agent that stops working because a governance service is redeploying. So
:meth:`MandateGate.decide` reads an immutable in-memory snapshot and returns;
:meth:`MandateGate.refresh` is what talks to the network, on a schedule
comfortably inside the snapshot's own ``max_staleness_s``.

Two server fields, two different questions
------------------------------------------
``mandate_enforcement`` (``enforce`` | ``observe``) answers *does a scope
breach count as a violation* — it is the tenant's rollout dial, and ``observe``
is how a bank watches what an agent would have been blocked from doing before
turning the block on.

``enforcement_posture`` (``fail_open`` | ``fail_closed``) answers a question
about this runtime, not about the agent: *what happens when we cannot
evaluate*. They are not the same dial and collapsing them loses the ability to
run an observing agent under a fail-closed posture, which is exactly the
configuration a first rollout wants.

============================================  ==============  ===============
Situation                                     fail_open       fail_closed
============================================  ==============  ===============
fresh, tool in scope                          allow           allow
fresh, out of scope, ``enforce``              deny            deny
fresh, out of scope, ``observe``              allow + flag    allow + flag
stale past ``max_staleness_s``                allow + flag    **deny**
agent suspended                               **deny**        **deny**
no snapshot ever fetched                      allow + flag    **deny**
============================================  ==============  ===============

Suspension denies under both postures: a suspension is a decision Coriqo
already made and this runtime read, not a failure to evaluate. And what trips
the fail-closed branch is *staleness*, not network reachability — a bounded,
configured budget rather than an incidental one. A gate that denied the moment
a request failed would turn every blip into an outage; this one keeps serving
the snapshot it has until that snapshot is older than the tenant said it may
be.

``allowed_tools``: null is not empty
------------------------------------
``null`` means **unrestricted** — no scope constraint on this agent.
``[]`` means **nothing is permitted**. Both are valid on the wire and they are
opposite instructions, so :class:`MandateSnapshot` keeps them apart (``None``
vs ``()``) and never uses a falsy test to tell them apart. Coercing ``null``
into ``[]`` blocks a legitimately unrestricted agent; coercing the other way
opens an agent that was explicitly permitted nothing.

Denials are terminal, and quiet
-------------------------------
A :class:`Deny` is not a tool error. If a denial reaches the model as an
ordinary failure — worse, one naming the tool and the scope — the model does
what a competent agent should do with a failure: rephrase, try an adjacent
tool, and route around the control. So a ``Deny`` carries a single fixed
:data:`MODEL_MESSAGE` for anything the model may see, and everything an
operator needs (which tool, which mandate version, how stale, why) stays in
:attr:`Verdict.detail` and the logs.

        RequireApproval — it is NOT fired automatically from `decide()`,
        which stays pure. Deduped per `request_id` for the lifetime of this
        gate: a caller retrying the identical call gets RequireApproval
        again from decide() every time (harmless — Coriqo's own endpoint is
        idempotent on request_id too), but this method only invokes the
        report callback once per id, so a tight retry loop doesn't spam a
        report call on every attempt.

        report callback owns its own I/O and must never raise into this

        Marked reported only AFTER the callback returns without raising —

        a failure of the POST itself, but it does catch the synchronous
        failure mode that matters here: no running event loop to schedule

        Call this once at run start (with the tools/system prompt/model the
        run is about to use), and again whenever the mandate snapshot
        refreshes if the locally computed digest has changed — the caller
        drives both call sites, the same explicit-second-step shape as
        :meth:`report_approval_request`, since this method (like that one)
        does its own I/O and must never run on :meth:`decide`'s path.

        Returns ``True`` if a report was (attempted to be) sent, ``False`` if
        skipped because the digest matches the last one this gate sent —
        the etag-style skip the spec calls for. There is no
        ``capability_digest`` field on the mandate snapshot to compare
        against yet (Coriqo's side of that addition was not visible when
        this was written), so the comparison is against this gate's own
        last-sent digest instead: correct within one process's lifetime,
        but it does mean a fresh process always attests once on its first
        call, even if an identical process on the same host attested the
        same surface five minutes ago. ``force=True`` bypasses the skip

        attestation regardless of local state).

        the callback owns its own I/O (typically scheduling

        fire-and-forget task) and a failure here never raises — it only
        means Coriqo's capability record for this agent may lag what is
        actually running, not that anything local breaks.

        ``store_system_prompt`` defaults to ``False``: the raw prompt text
        is never sent unless the caller explicitly opts in. This runtime has
        no visibility into a Coriqo-side ``store_system_prompt`` policy
        field on the snapshot yet, so "never send it unless asked" is the
        safe default until that field exists and can be read here instead.
