The verifier trusts nothing that the recorder wrote about itself. It re-derives

reports missing sequence numbers and unpaired tool events.

    """Re-derive and check the hash chain over normalized entries.

    Each item in ``entries`` must have ``seq`` (int), ``prev_hash`` (str),
    ``entry_hash`` (str) and ``event`` (the event mapping, already parsed) —
    the same shape whether it came from an ``agent_events`` row or a bundle's
    ``entries`` array. This is the one chain-walking implementation; both
    :func:`verify_ledger` and :func:`verify_bundle` call it so a finding in
    one can never fail to appear in the other.

    ``starting_public_key_b64``, when given, is a key the CALLER trusts (a
    pinned key, or the key the caller connected with) — never anything read
    out of the untrusted chain data itself. When supplied, the walk builds
    the active device key/id live, inline, as it walks: each ``KEY_ROTATED``
    entry is checked against ``active_key``/``active_id`` as of that point
    (see :func:`_check_rotation_live`), and only a rotation that passes all
    four of its conditions advances them. This is what closes the "retired
    key re-rotation" gap: a rotation forged by a device holding a RETIRED
    key cannot take over the timeline, because its ``old_device_id`` will
    not match the walk's own ``active_id`` — no matter what
    ``device_public_keys`` says. Every non-rotation entry whose
    ``device_id`` no longer matches ``active_id`` at its seq is also a
    finding (folded into ``stale_key_usage``).

    ``device_public_keys`` remains supported for backward compatibility
    (and is exactly what's used when ``starting_public_key_b64`` is
    ``None`` — the original, note-based "can't verify rotations without a
    key" behaviour) but can never override the live timeline: if both are
    given and a rotation's ``new_device_id`` has an entry in
    ``device_public_keys`` that disagrees with its actual ``new_public_key``,
    that's surfaced as a note, not used for anything.
