"""Local record of every trace sent to Coriqo, and the receipts fetched for them.

``publish_session`` writes one row per trace it sends, keyed by
``(session_id, step_index)``, BEFORE the request goes out. It then reconciles
each row against the response: a row whose trace came back with an
``event_hash`` is acknowledged; a row that did not (omitted from ``traces``,
empty or missing hash, or a ``recorded`` count larger than the traces listed)
stays unacknowledged. ``verify.verify_receipts`` reports an unacknowledged row
older than the configured age as ``unacknowledged``, so a server that swallows
an event is caught even though it never returned anything to store.

Each row also keeps the input/output hashes computed locally from what was
sent. The response echoes ``input_hash`` and ``output_hash``; a difference is a
``content_mismatch`` finding. That proves the echoed record matches what was
sent. It does NOT prove the server's sealed event hash covers those fields:
only the inclusion proof plus Coriqo's own event schema speak to that.

A background pass later asks Coriqo for the receipt of each acknowledged row
old enough to be covered by a checkpoint and stores the bundle beside it.

KNOWN LIMITATION: the store is an UNSIGNED JSON sidecar
(``<ledger>.receipts.json``). Anyone who can write that file can delete rows,
and a deleted row is not detectable from the file alone. The receipt bundles
themselves are checked cryptographically (against a pinned key); the list of
which traces SHOULD have receipts is not. Treat a clean report as "nothing in
this file is wrong", not as "nothing was omitted from this file".

Only traces sent through ``publish_session`` are tracked. The ``Shipper`` path
ships ledger entries to the ingest endpoint, whose response carries no
per-trace ``event_hash`` to reconcile against, so it cannot feed this store.

Concurrency: one process-wide lock per resolved store path, plus an OS file
lock (``fcntl.flock`` on POSIX, on a ``.lock`` sibling) around every
load-mutate-save, so threads and separate processes lose no rows. Writes go to
a uniquely named temp file, are fsynced, then ``os.replace``d. A corrupt or
unreadable store raises :class:`ReceiptStoreError`; it is never treated as
empty and never overwritten.

Nothing here may block or fail the request path: fetch errors are logged and
retried next pass.
