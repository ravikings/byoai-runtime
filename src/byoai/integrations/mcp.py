"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) transport — expose a ByoAI runtime as an MCP
tool server, so any MCP client (Claude Desktop, another agent, your own
orchestrator) can call it exactly like it calls any other tool.

Mount into an existing ASGI app (FastAPI/Starlette) instead of running
standalone::

    from byoai.integrations.mcp import attach
    attach(app, runtime, path="/mcp")   # exposes POST/GET /mcp (streamable HTTP)

Requires the ``mcp`` extra: ``pip install byoai-runtime[mcp]``.

    Two things ``app.mount()`` alone doesn't give you, both handled here:

    * The MCP sub-app has its own ASGI lifespan (it starts the streamable-HTTP
      session manager's task group); Starlette never cascades a parent app's
      lifespan into a mounted sub-app, so without this the session manager
      never starts and every request 500s. We enter/exit that lifespan
      manually via the host app's startup/shutdown hooks.
    * ``server.streamable_http_app()`` registers its own internal route at
      ``streamable_http_path`` — mounting *that* app again at ``path`` would
      double the prefix (``path`` + ``path``). We register the sub-app's
      internal route at ``"/"`` so ``path`` is applied exactly once, by
      ``app.mount()``.

    Requires the host app to support ``add_event_handler`` (FastAPI's
    router, or Starlette apps not yet on the lifespan-only contract) so we
    have somewhere to hook the sub-app's startup/shutdown — raises
    :class:`ConfigurationError` immediately if it doesn't, rather than
    mounting an endpoint that would 500 on every request. Plain modern
    Starlette apps (``lifespan=`` only) aren't supported by this helper;
