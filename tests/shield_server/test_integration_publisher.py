"""THE integration test the plan asks for: the real, unmodified
``shield_publish.Publisher`` (and the ``SealChain`` it publishes) running
against ``create_app()`` over an httpx ASGI transport — proof that "the
client works unchanged" is not just a claim.

Flow: enrol (minted token) -> publish a seal -> admin PUTs a policy -> device
polls, verifies, applies it -> the admin device list shows it protecting at
the assigned version with no drift -> revoke -> next publish gets the
refusal state.
