"""Device key rotation and revocation for the agent recorder (spec §8.4).

Rotation replaces a device's Ed25519 keypair while preserving verifiable
continuity of the ledger's hash chain across the key boundary: the OLD key
cross-signs the NEW public key, the new key material is staged to disk
*without* touching the live key files, and only once that cross-signature is
durably sealed into the ledger as a ``KEY_ROTATED`` event does the staged
key get promoted to the live filenames (and the old key archived). This
ordering guarantees three independent safety properties instead of trading
one for another: the new private key is never lost to a crash (it is
durably staged before the ledger append is attempted), the old key is never
destroyed unless the ledger append actually succeeded (so a failed or
interrupted append always leaves the device able to keep operating, and
retrying rotation, under its old identity — never in the state of a
device_id change with no matching KEY_ROTATED event to explain it), and
once the KEY_ROTATED event *has* been committed, promotion of the staged
key to the live filenames can never be lost to a crash either: promotion
(``keys._finish_pending_rotation``) changes what counts as "the live key"
via a single atomic ``os.replace`` rather than two separate replaces with a
gap between them, and ``load_or_create_device_key`` reconciles any
leftover staged key on every load before ever considering "no live key ->
generate a new one". So there is no reachable crash point, before or after
a KEY_ROTATED event, that causes the device to silently start using a
fresh, never-cross-signed random identity.

Revocation reuses the same mechanism with ``reason="revocation"`` (or
``"compromise"``): the event's ``effective_epoch`` marks the point after
which entries still attributed to the old device are no longer trusted,
while entries signed before it remain valid (spec §8.4).

Client-side only. Anchoring the revocation event externally (Coriqo) is out
of scope here; it will ship like any other ledger event via the shipper.

    """Rotate this device's Ed25519 key, cross-signed for chain continuity.

    Generates a new keypair, has the CURRENT on-disk key cross-sign the new
    public key, and durably *stages* the new key files under a pending-
    rotation subdirectory (not the live filenames). Only after the
    ``KEY_ROTATED`` event has been successfully appended to ``ledger`` —
    signed as the OLD device — is the staged key promoted into the live
    ``PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME``/``PUBLIC_KEY_FILENAME`` location, with the old
    key archived alongside it rather than deleted.

    This order means a crash or failure at any point leaves the device in a
    recoverable state:

    * Staging happens before the ledger append, so the new private key is
      never the *only* copy anywhere that can vanish — it is fsync'd to disk
      before anything durable is attempted against the ledger.
    * The live key files are only ever touched *after* the ledger append is
      confirmed to have succeeded, so a failed append (or a crash between
      staging and promotion) leaves the OLD key fully intact and loadable —
      the device keeps operating under its old identity and rotation can be
      retried cleanly. This avoids the previous bug where the old key file
      was overwritten before the append was confirmed: if the append then
      failed, the old key was gone but the ledger's chain still ended on
      entries signed by the old device_id, with no KEY_ROTATED event to
      explain the eventual device_id change on next load.

    ``ledger`` must belong to the same device being rotated (its
    ``device_id`` should match the old key's, since the event needs to be
    appended under that identity before it changes).
