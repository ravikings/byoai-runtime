"""Seam B: enforce the mandate at the proxy, on the model's own response.

``@governed_tool`` (Seam A) needs the integrator to decorate their tool
functions, and that is a source change to code the buyer frequently does not
own. This module needs nothing from the agent at all: the proxy is already
sitting at ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` and already parses ``tool_use`` blocks out of
responses, and a component that can read a tool call before the agent sees it
can also refuse it.

The rule is decided by the same :class:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.MandateGate`
Seam A uses, routed through the same :class:`~byoai.recorder.denial_latch.DenialLatch`
and written down by the same :class:`~byoai.recorder.verdicts.VerdictRecorder`.
There is deliberately no second policy path here — two implementations of one
enforcement rule drift, and then one of them is wrong.

What a denial looks like
------------------------
The ``tool_use`` block is **withheld**: it never reaches the agent, so there is
nothing for the agent's dispatcher to execute. In its place goes a synthesized
block carrying the single fixed sentence
(:data:`~byoai.recorder.mandate.MODEL_MESSAGE`) — never the tool name, never
the mandate, never a suggested alternative. At this seam that text lands
directly in the model's next context window, so a denial that explained itself
would be a hint sheet for routing around the control.

Coverage, stated plainly
------------------------
This covers tools the *model requests through the intercepted provider API*. A
tool the agent's own code calls directly — a helper it invokes without asking
the model, an MCP client it drives itself — never appears in a response body
and is invisible here. That is what Seam A is for. The two seams compose;
neither alone is total.

# from configuration the *operator* controls; a request cannot introduce an

# and a client-supplied agent id that could name any mandate would let it pick
# its own scope by editing one header.

# when one proxy fronts several agents. It cannot widen anything. A header
# naming an unregistered agent, or an ambiguous request when several gates are
# registered and none was named, is unresolved — and unresolved is decided by
# posture (fail_closed denies, fail_open allows and flags), never by silently
