"""CEI chain-head computation, ported from Coriqo's own algorithm.

Coriqo's ``api/chain.py``/``api/domains/agents/attestation_ingest.py``
compute a CEI envelope's ``chain_head`` as:

    H_0 = GENESIS_PREV_HASH  ("0" * 64)
    H_n = sha256_hex(H_{n-1}.encode("utf-8") + canonical_bytes(event_n))

over events already in ascending ``seq`` order (Coriqo's ingest refuses to
sort for you — see ``attestation_ingest.compute_chain_head``'s docstring).
This is a straight port of that function, byte-for-byte, so byoai-runtime
can compute the same ``chain_head`` locally that Coriqo will compute
server-side for the same event list, and detect drift before shipping.

Canonicalization: Coriqo's ``canonical_bytes()`` is Python's ``json.dumps``
with ``sort_keys=True``, no insignificant whitespace, UTF-8. This repo's
``canonical.py`` implements RFC 8785 (JCS) instead, which differs from
Coriqo's scheme in number formatting and non-BMP key ordering in principle
— but AIR-4 already pinned byte-identical output between the two for the
payload-hash case (dict of JSON-safe primitives, ASCII/BMP keys, no floats
needing ECMAScript-specific formatting), which is the same shape of input a
CEI event is. We reuse ``canonicalize()`` here on that same basis rather
than duplicating a second canonicalizer; the parity fixture in
``tests/recorder/test_attestation.py`` is what actually proves it for the
chain-head computation specifically, not just asserted by this comment.

The hash itself must be raw lowercase hex, with NO ``"sha256:"`` prefix —
that prefix is this repo's own local-ledger convention
(``canonical.sha256_hex``), not Coriqo's. Reusing that helper here would
produce a value that no longer matches ``chain_head`` byte-for-byte, so this
module hashes directly with :mod:`hashlib` instead.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# §5 open question 1: which local EventKinds are CEI-attestable.
#
# Spec recommendation was TOOL_USE + TOOL_RESULT for the first cut. That is
# NOT what this packet ships, and the deviation is deliberate, not an
# oversight: AIR-7b (the packet immediately before this one) already landed
# and threads `resource`/`on_behalf_of` onto exactly one event kind —
# MANDATE_VERDICT, inside `verdicts.py::ledger_payload()` — and nowhere else.
# TOOL_USE/TOOL_RESULT events carry neither field today (governed_tool.py's
# `_record()` for a raw tool call has no equivalent threading). An envelope
# builder that tried to attest TOOL_USE/TOOL_RESULT per the spec's literal
# recommendation would ship `resource`/`on_behalf_of`-less events, defeating
# the entire point of the CEI v2 fields this program exists to populate.
#
# So the call made here: MANDATE_VERDICT is the (only) CEI-attestable kind
# for this first cut. It is already "an attestable decision" (the spec's own
# words when floating this as a *future* option), it is the one kind that
# actually carries `resource`/`on_behalf_of` today, and every governed tool
# call already produces exactly one MANDATE_VERDICT event by construction
# (verdicts.py records allow/flag/block alike, not just denials) — so this
# does not lose tool-call coverage relative to attesting TOOL_USE directly,
# it reuses the row that already has the richer, mandate-checked shape.
# TOOL_USE/TOOL_RESULT attestation (and whether a pair collapses to one CEI
# event, per §5 open question 2 — moot here since neither kind is attested)
# is left for a follow-up packet, same as the spec already deferred
# MANDATE_VERDICT-as-attestable to "its own follow-up" — just the other kind
# turned out to be the one ready first.

    """Map a batch of local ledger entries onto a CEI v2 envelope.

    ``entries`` is expected to already be the same ``(seq_start, seq_end)``
    window a checkpoint covers (spec §3c — this does not invent its own
    windowing; the caller reads ``ledger.read_range(seq_start, seq_end)`` and
    hands the result straight in), in ascending local ``seq`` order, which is
    how :meth:`Ledger.read_range` already returns them.

    ``agent`` is the CEI envelope's ``subject`` (``agent_id``, optionally
    ``agent_version``); ``device`` is the ``emitter`` (``kind``, ``vendor``,
    optionally ``software_version``); ``window`` is ``{started_at, ended_at}``
    — the caller's job, not this function's, since only the caller knows
    whether that should be the checkpoint's own timestamps or something else.

    Only entries whose kind is in :data:`CEI_ATTESTABLE_KINDS` are attested;
    everything else in the window is dropped from the envelope and stays
    local-only, exactly as before this packet.

    ``seq`` is renumbered starting at 1 within the envelope — CEI's ``seq`` is
    a per-window sequence, not the local ledger's never-reset one (spec §2) —
    so an envelope's ``seq`` values say nothing about an event's position in
    the local chain, only its position in this one attestation.

    ``payload_hash`` is recomputed here with this module's raw-hex
    :func:`_sha256_hex_raw`, never copied from ``AgentEvent.payload_hash``:
    the local ledger's hash carries a ``"sha256:"`` prefix (see
    ``canonical.sha256_hex``) that is this repo's own convention, not
    Coriqo's — reusing it verbatim would produce a `payload_hash` Coriqo's
    own recompute (``sha256_hex(canonical_bytes(payload))``, no prefix) can
    never match, refusing the whole envelope on ingest.

    ``on_behalf_of`` is always present on every event, even as an empty list,
    which is what makes this envelope self-identify as v2 to Coriqo's
    ``envelope_schema_version()`` (v2 is detected by *presence* of the key,
    not by a value) — per spec §3b, this runtime emits v2 always going
    forward, never v1. ``resource`` is included only when the local payload
    actually named one; it is optional on both sides.
