"""Delegated scope attenuation: what an agent may do on someone else's behalf.

Two relations get confused with each other, and only one of them attenuates.

**Nesting** is a sub-run of the *same* agent — a planner step, a retry loop, a
nested trace. One agent, one mandate, and that mandate already scopes the whole
thing. Narrowing a nested run would be narrowing an agent against itself.

**Delegation** is agent A handing work to agent B. Different agents, and the
interesting question is which mandate governs B's tool calls while it is working
for A. Not B's own: for the duration of that work B has *no mandate of its own*,
because nobody approved B to act inside A's task. Its effective scope is the
**intersection** of B's standing mandate with A's effective scope at the moment
of delegation, pinned to A's ``mandate_version_id``.

Intersection is the whole point, and it is one-directional: delegation can only
narrow. If it could widen, spawning a sub-agent would be a route to tools the
parent was refused — and it would be the *easy* route, since a model that has
just been denied is one prompt away from asking a helper to do it. Attenuation
is what makes "delegate it to another agent" a strictly worse idea than doing it
directly, which is the property you want.

The child's standing mandate is untouched by any of this. B is still B when it
runs its own work; the narrowing lives on the :class:`EffectiveScope` built for
one delegated run.

Null is not empty
-----------------
``allowed_tools = None`` means *unrestricted*; ``allowed_tools = []`` means
*nothing is permitted*. Opposite instructions, and a falsy check reads them the
same way — which is exactly how "permitted nothing" becomes "permitted
everything". So :func:`intersect_tools` branches on ``is None`` and nothing
else: unrestricted ∩ X is X, X ∩ unrestricted is X, and anything ∩ ``[]`` is
``[]``.

Two dials from the snapshot
---------------------------
``delegation_policy`` (``none`` | ``attenuated``) says whether this agent may
delegate at all. Anything else — absent, unrecognised — is treated as ``none``:
a snapshot that does not say delegation was approved has not approved it.

``max_delegation_depth`` bounds the chain. ``None`` means the tenant did not
bound it, and ``0`` means no delegation at all, which is why the check is
``is not None`` rather than a truth test.

An **undeclared** delegation — one Coriqo was never told about — gets the empty
scope rather than a refusal. It denies every tool under ``enforce``, which is
the same practical outcome, but it is a decision the record can explain instead
of a crash in the integrator's spawn path.
