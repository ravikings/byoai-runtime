"""Batching shipper for the agent recorder — workstream G.

Reads confirmed-unsynced entries off the local :class:`~byoai.recorder.ledger.Ledger`,
batches them (spec §9.2: 100 events, 1 MB, or 5 seconds — whichever trips
first), gzips and signs the batch, and POSTs it to Coriqo's
``/v1/ingest/batch``. Delivery is at-least-once: the server dedupes on
``entry_hash``, so a batch that gets partially or fully resent after a crash
or a timeout is harmless.

The ledger is the source of truth (spec §9.1) — this module never blocks the
agent and never raises out of :meth:`Shipper.run_forever`; failures are
logged and retried with backoff.

        Generic over which watermark: ``ship_once`` passes the entry
        watermark accessors with the server's reported ``gaps`` ranges;
        ``ship_checkpoints_once`` passes the checkpoint watermark accessors
        with single-point ranges built from the server's ``rejected``
        seq_ends. Same discipline either way: a gapped/rejected seq (and
        everything after it in this batch) is left unsynced so the next
        attempt retries it.
