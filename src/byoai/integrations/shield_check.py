"""``byoai shield check-file``: does a produced file match a sealed record?

Answers "that isn't the file I sent" and "that file broke no rule" from the
record alone. It reads the local seal log, never the ledger's text, and prints
three verdicts:

* ``hash``             whether the file's SHA-256 equals the sealed one;
* ``rules reproduce``  whether running the rules on the file gives the rule
                       hits the record names (refused when the record was made
                       by a different version of the rules);
* ``seal verifies``    whether the record is intact in the sealed chain.

Exit status is 0 only when every check that applies passes.
